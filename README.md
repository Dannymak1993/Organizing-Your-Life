# How Well Do You Know Rock Climbing?

## Description

What I have created is a calendar app that you can use to keep track of your busy daily schedule. The reason I built this product is to to incorporate the new concepts learned in Jquery, dayJS , event listeners, objects and local storage. Mastery of these concepts will help with future projects of larger magnitude.

## Usage

Navigate to the urls located below and click inside time block text areas to begin planning out your day. Remember to click the save button to save that text to your local storage so that it stays upon refresh of the page. You can edit the text and overwrite it if you need to change it at a later date, or clear cache. You should notice that the time blocks will change color automatically based on the local time. Grey means that time block has already passed, red means that the current time block is lined up with your current local time, and green means a time block that is coming up.

## Credits

I googled many concepts referring to Jquery and DayJS. I also used both of those in my HTML so they are linked accordingly.
